<h1>Workflow Poster — Terms of Service</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 16, 2023</p>

<p>These Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a legally binding agreement between <strong>C4 Marketing LLC</strong> (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) and the person or entity who accesses or uses Workflow Poster (the “<strong>Service</strong>,” “<strong>Workflow Poster</strong>,” or the “<strong>App</strong>”) (“<strong>you</strong>” or “<strong>Customer</strong>”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you are accepting on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization, and “you” refers to that organization.</p>

<p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. The Service</h2>

<p>Workflow Poster is a workflow tool that helps authorized TikTok users prepare, upload, and publish short‑form videos and retrieve related account and content information for analytics. The Service can (i) upload media to a user’s TikTok account either for inbox review or direct publishing (when permitted), and (ii) read basic profile information and lists of videos to support performance tracking. The Service may integrate with third‑party providers you connect (e.g., rendering, storage, voice synthesis, or analytics services). You control whether and how your TikTok account is connected and what actions the Service may take on your behalf.</p>

<p><strong>Current deployment.</strong> The Service is currently used <strong>internally by C4 Marketing LLC</strong> for a single TikTok Business account. No third parties are authorized users.</p>

<p>The Service <strong>does not</strong> provide investment, legal, tax, or compliance advice. You are solely responsible for your content and for complying with all applicable laws and platform rules.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Eligibility; Account Registration</h2>

<p>You must be at least 18 years old and capable of forming a binding contract to use the Service. To use API posting features, you must have a valid TikTok account (typically a <strong>Business</strong> account) and complete any identity, security, or authorization steps required by TikTok. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your accounts.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Your Authorization to the Service</h2>

<h3>3.1 Connecting your TikTok Account</h3>
You may connect your TikTok account to the Service using TikTok’s authorization flow. By doing so, you authorize the Service to act on your behalf only within the scopes/permissions you approve (for example, uploading or publishing videos, reading basic profile information, or listing your videos). You can revoke this authorization at any time in your TikTok settings or within the Service. Revocation may disable some or all Service features.

<h3>3.2 Posting Modes; Visibility</h3>
The Service may support multiple posting modes, including <strong>Upload to Inbox</strong> (content delivered to your TikTok inbox for your in‑app review and posting) and <strong>Direct Post</strong> (automatic publishing to your profile). <strong>Direct Post</strong> may require specific TikTok permissions and TikTok’s approval/audit of the app. If the app has not completed TikTok’s audit, posts may be restricted to <strong>private</strong> visibility until approval is granted. You are responsible for reviewing settings and confirming that any publish action meets your needs and compliance obligations.

<h3>3.3 Domain/URL Verification for Pull‑From‑URL</h3>
If you choose to provide media via a URL for TikTok to fetch, you may be required to verify the ownership of that domain or URL prefix in TikTok’s developer settings. If you do not verify ownership, TikTok may reject the transfer. As an alternative, the Service may use direct file upload when available.

<h3>3.4 Rate Limits; Retries</h3>
TikTok imposes limits on requests and posting frequency. The Service may implement throttling, queuing, and retries, but you acknowledge that requests may be delayed, limited, or rejected by TikTok or other providers. We are not responsible for platform‑imposed limits or outages.

<hr>

<h2>4. Your Content</h2>

<h3>4.1 Ownership</h3>
As between you and us, you retain all rights in content you submit to or through the Service (the “<strong>User Content</strong>”). You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide, royalty‑free license to host, store, process, transmit, display, and otherwise use User Content solely to provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Service and to comply with law.

<h3>4.2 Responsibility and Compliance</h3>
You are solely responsible for User Content and for ensuring that your use of the Service and your content comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third‑party terms, including TikTok’s terms, policies, and community guidelines, and any rules applicable to financial promotions, investment advertising, endorsements, disclosures, and recordkeeping. You will not post or submit content that is illegal, infringing, deceptive, harmful, or violates privacy, publicity, intellectual‑property, or other rights. You are responsible for obtaining all necessary rights, clearances, and permissions, including for music, images, voices, and other third‑party materials used in your content.

<h3>4.3 No Platform Affiliation</h3>
The Service is not endorsed by or affiliated with TikTok, ByteDance, or any other platform provider. Your relationship with TikTok and other platforms remains governed by their respective terms.

<h3>4.4 Moderation and Removals</h3>
We may (but are not obligated to) review or remove content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or the law. TikTok or other platforms may also remove, restrict, or downrank content at their discretion.

<hr>

<h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>

<p>The Service may rely on or interoperate with third‑party products and services, including but not limited to TikTok, OpenAI (script generation), ElevenLabs (voice synthesis), Shotstack (video rendering), Dropbox or other storage providers, HTMLCSStoImage (image rendering), and analytics tools (collectively, “<strong>Third‑Party Services</strong>”). Your use of Third‑Party Services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for Third‑Party Services. We may replace or modify Third‑Party Services at any time.</p>

</ul>

<hr>

<h2>7. Fees and Payment</h2>

<p><strong>Current plan.</strong> The Service is provided to you <strong>at no charge</strong>.

<p><strong>Future fees.</strong> We may introduce paid plans or usage‑based fees in the future. If we do, we will provide you with <strong>at least 30 days’ notice</strong> and an updated fee schedule. Continued use after the effective date of the new fees constitutes acceptance. If you do not agree, you must stop using the Service before the change takes effect.</p>

<hr>

<h2>8. Privacy</h2>

<p>Our collection and use of personal information in connection with the Service is described in our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, which is incorporated by reference.

<h2>9. Confidentiality; Security</h2>

<p>We will implement commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data and User Content.
