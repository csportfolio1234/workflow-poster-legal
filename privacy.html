<h1>Workflow Poster — Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 16, 2023  
<strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 26, 2025</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>C4 Marketing LLC</strong> ("<strong>C4 Marketing</strong>," "<strong>we</strong>," "<strong>us</strong>," or "<strong>our</strong>") collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use <strong>Workflow Poster</strong> (the "<strong>Service</strong>" or the "<strong>App</strong>"). If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.</p>

<p>We operate the Service for internal use with a single TikTok Business account. If you later authorize additional users, this Policy will govern their use as well.</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Information you provide to us</h3><ul>

<li><strong>Account connection data.</strong> When you connect a TikTok account, we receive OAuth authorization information (e.g., access tokens, refresh tokens, token expiry, granted scopes) and a TikTok user identifier. </li>
<li><strong>Content and metadata.</strong> When you prepare or upload videos, we process titles/captions, media files, thumbnails, and timing/visibility settings you configure. </li>
<li><strong>Support communications.</strong> If you contact us by email, we collect the content of your message and related contact details.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Information we obtain automatically</h3><ul>

<li><strong>Usage logs.</strong> We may log event timestamps, API requests, status codes, error messages, queue/latency metrics, and file sizes/durations for reliability and security. </li>
<li><strong>Device & technical data.</strong> When accessing a hosted dashboard, we (or our hosting providers) may collect IP address, browser type, operating system, and referring URLs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Information from third parties</h3><ul>

<li><strong>TikTok.</strong> Subject to your authorization, we may receive account basics (e.g., user ID, username, avatar URL) and lists of videos you published or uploaded. Depending on the scopes you grant and API availability, we may also retrieve post status and basic performance metrics. </li>
<li><strong>Other services you connect.</strong> If you connect external tools (e.g., Google Sheets for logging analytics), we receive the minimum information necessary to write/read the requested data.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect sensitive categories of personal information (e.g., government IDs, health or biometric data) through the Service.</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
We use information to:
1. <strong>Provide the Service.</strong> Authenticate with TikTok; upload or publish videos; retrieve allowed account and video information; queue, render, and deliver media; maintain logs. 
2. <strong>Operate, secure, and improve.</strong> Monitor performance, debug issues, prevent abuse, enforce limits, and enhance reliability and features. 
3. <strong>Communicate with you.</strong> Respond to inquiries, provide technical support, and send service or policy updates. 
4. <strong>Comply with law.</strong> Satisfy legal obligations, enforce agreements, and protect rights, safety, and integrity of the Service.

<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information. We do not use personal information for targeted advertising as defined by certain privacy laws. If this changes, we will update this Policy and provide required notices and choices.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3. Legal Bases (EEA/UK)</h2>
Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we process personal data on the following legal bases:<ul>

<li><strong>Contractual necessity:</strong> To provide and support the Service you request. </li>
<li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> To secure, improve, and analyze the Service; prevent fraud and misuse. </li>
<li><strong>Legal obligations:</strong> To comply with applicable laws and respond to lawful requests. </li>
<li><strong>Consent:</strong> Where required (e.g., certain cookies/analytics or optional features) — you may withdraw consent at any time.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
We share information as follows:<ul>

<li><strong>Service providers / processors.</strong> We use vendors to host, render, store, transcribe, or analyze content, or to send communications. Typical providers include: </li>
</ul>
  - <strong>TikTok</strong> (API, posting, account and video data) 
  - <strong>OpenAI</strong> (script generation)
  - <strong>ElevenLabs</strong> (voice synthesis)
  - <strong>Shotstack</strong> (video rendering)
  - <strong>Dropbox</strong> (file storage/transfer)
  - <strong>HTMLCSStoImage</strong> (HTML-to-image rendering)
  - <strong>Google</strong> (e.g., Google Sheets for logs or analytics)
  - <strong>Hosting/orchestration</strong> (e.g., n8n server, cloud hosting, logging/monitoring)<ul>

<li><strong>Business transfers.</strong> In connection with a merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets, data may be transferred subject to confidentiality and applicable law.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and safety.</strong> We may disclose information to comply with legal process or to protect rights, property, safety, or the integrity of the Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5. International Transfers</h2>
We may transfer, store, and process information in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards, such as <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong> for transfers of personal data from the EEA/UK to countries without an adequacy decision.

<hr>

<h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Tokens and logs are retained for operational and security needs and are deleted or anonymized when no longer required. You may ask us to delete certain data (see <strong>Your Rights</strong> below); we will honor requests consistent with legal and contractual requirements.

<hr>

<h2>7. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
Depending on your location, you may have rights to:<ul>

<li><strong>Access</strong> personal information we hold about you; </li>
<li><strong>Correct</strong> inaccurate personal information; </li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> personal information; </li>
<li><strong>Port</strong> personal information; </li>
<li><strong>Object to</strong> or <strong>restrict</strong> certain processing; and</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw consent</strong> where processing is based on consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <strong>chandler.smith33@gmail.com</strong>. We may request information to verify your identity. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority where you live or work.</p>

<h3>State privacy rights (United States)</h3>
If you are a resident of a U.S. state with a comprehensive privacy law (e.g., California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah), you may have similar rights under state law. We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information or share it for cross‑context behavioral advertising as defined by these laws. You may authorize an agent to submit requests on your behalf, subject to verification.

<hr>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for keeping credentials confidential and promptly notifying us of any suspected compromise.

<hr>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
The Service is not directed to or intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

<hr>

<h2>10. Third‑Party Services and Links</h2>
The Service may link to or integrate with third‑party services. This Policy does not cover third‑party practices. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.

<hr>

<h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
We may update this Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated Policy with a new <strong>Last Updated</strong> date and, where required, provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date of the changes constitutes acceptance.
